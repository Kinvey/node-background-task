node-background-task
====================

Distributed task execution framework for [node](http://nodejs.org), backed by [redis](http://redis.io/).
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Kinvey/node-background-task.png)](https://travis-ci.org/Kinvey/node-background-task)


```js
var bgTask = require('background-task').connect({ taskKey: 'someKey' })
  , task;

task = {
  someKey      : 'someValue',
  someOtherKey : ['someValues', 'someMoreValues']
};

bgTask.addTask(task, function(resp){
    console.log(resp);
});
```

## Installation

    $ npm install background-task

## Quick Start

Background tasks involve two concepts, creators and workers.  Creators
have tasks that they need executed, workers know how to execute
tasks. Workers listen for events tagged with a specific *task* and
execute them. Should no worker execute the task in a specific time
(which can be customized) then a failure is reported back.

Additionally, the amount of active tasks can be limited using a "task
key" (which must be a property at the top level of you task object),
where only N tasks can be pending on a certain key prior to failures.

### Task Creators

* `connect(options)` -- Creates a new instance of a BackgroundTask, allowing you
  to specify options.
* `addTask(task, callback[, progress])` -- Schedule a task for background
  execution, calling progress on task progress and `callback when complete.


### Task Workers

Processing for a worker is kicked off by the `TASK_AVAILABLE` event,
once you get this event you can either accept the task, or ignore the
task.  If multiple workers accept the task then the first to accept
will handle the task.

* `connect(options)` -- Create a new instance of a BackgroundTask,
  allowing you to specify options.  You must specify `isWorker: true`
  to register as a background worker.
* `acceptTask(callback)` -- Accepts a task from the queue to start processing,
  callback must accept two args, `id` and a paramater for the task.
* `completeTask(taskId, status, msg)` -- Mark a task as complete.
* `progressTask(taskId, msg)` -- Report task progress.


### Options

The `options` hash for creators and workers allows you to set:

* `host` -- redis host.
* `maxTasksPerKey` -- limit the amount of active tasks based on the "task key".
* `password` -- redis password.
* `port` -- redis port.
* `taskKey` -- the task key.
* `task` -- listen for specific tasks only.
* `timeout` -- task timeout (in ms).


### Events

node-background-task uses the following events:

* `TASK_AVAILABLE` -- There is data available for a background worker.
* `TASK_DONE` -- A task has finished and the response is ready, task
  may not be successful, just complete.
* `TASK_PROGRESS` -- Progress is reported for a task. 
* `TASK_ERROR` -- Something went wrong.


## Features

* Lightweight
* Backed by [redis](http://redis.io/) (Can be portable to other DBs)
* Callback and Event based
* Easy to build distributed architectures
* Workers are event driven, not polling
* Task limiting

## Why?

We looked at the excellent
[coffee-resque](https://github.com/technoweenie/coffee-resque)
project to fit an internal need, however we needed a non-polling based
worker architecture.  There are up and down-sides to this approach,
but the balance was correct for the architecture that we're creating
at [Kinvey](http://www.kinvey.com).
